# # `xkcd` Name Dominoes
# 
# The March 21, 2018 `xkcd` comic (#1970) was [Name Dominoes](https://xkcd.com/1970/): domino tiles laid out as if in a game, but the tiles contain names of famous people rather than numbers. 
# In [dominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes) each tile has two halves, and a tile can be legally placed only if  one half is adjacent to another tile half with the same number/name, and neither half is adjacent to a tile half with a different number/name. (Exception: the very first tile can be placed anywhere.) 
# 
# I will write a function to lay out tiles in a random, legal array.  First, the key data structures:
# 
# - **`Tile`**: a tile is a 2-element tuple of names, like `('TIM', 'COOK')`.
# The tile `('FRANK LLOYD', 'WRIGHT')` has a space in the first name.
# - **`Name`**: a name (first name or last name) is a string.
# - **`Board(width, height)`**: a `Board` represents
# a width Ã— height array of squares, initially `empty`, but  when we put a tile on the board,
# the first name covers one location and the last name covers an adjacent location, e.g. `board[0, 0], board[0, 1] = ('TIM', 'COOK')`. Implemented as a subtype of `dict` that keeps track of `width` and `height`.
# - **`Location`**: a location is an `(x, y)` pair of coordinates for a square on the board.
# 
# Now I need a strategy to fill the board with tiles.  I will randomly place tiles one at a time, and to make things easier I will *not* consider removing a tile from the board and backtracking. Some more concepts and functions:
# 
# - **`frontier`**: I'll maintain a *frontier*, a set of locations that are adjacent to tiles on the board, and thus are candidates for placing new tiles.
# - **`dominoes(tiles)`**: makes a board and places tiles on it, one at a time, until no more can be placed. Chooses a random tile for the first tile, then repeatedly calls `try_one` to legally place an additional tile, stopping when either there is no `frontier` left (meaning no place to legally place a tile) or no `tiles` left to place.
# - **`try_one(tiles, board, frontier)`**: pop a location off the frontier, and try to find some tile that can legally put one of its halves there; when found, `put` the tile there, and remove it from `tiles`.
# - **`legal(name, loc, board)`**: a name can be placed if the location is empty, and there are no conflicts with any neighboring location.
# - **`neighbors(loc, board)`**: returns the (up to 4) neighbors of a location that are on the board.
# - **`put_tile(board, loc0, loc1, tile, frontier)`**: places a tile on the board across `loc0` and `loc1`; update the `frontier` to say that the just-covered locations are no longer in the frontier, but the empty neighbors of the tile are.
# - **`shuffle(items)`**: used to randomize lists; calls `random.shuffle` and returns the result.

# # Pretty Output
# 
# Technically, this is a legal solution, but there are two problems with it: One, it is not visual. Two, it doesn't say where each tile is: when three names come together, which of the outside names goes with the middle name?  To fix those two problems I will:
# 
# - Define `plot_board(board)` to use `matplotlib` to plot the board, the names, and the tiles.
# - Modify the `Board` class and the `put` function so that the board maintains a list of `boxes` that surround each two-location rectangle that a tile occupies: `[loc0, loc1]`. The constant e is the distance between two adjacent tiles; we want them to not-quite touch (as in the xkcd comic).

# # Approximate and Partial Matches
# 
# Two tile halves match if they are an exact match, like "ADAMS" and "ADAMS", or if they are an **approximate match**, like "AMY" and "AIMEE". To accomodate this, you can manually define allowable approximate matches by making the global variable `synsets` (synonym sets) be a mapping from a name to the set of approximate matches it should match, which can be done like this:
# 
#      synsets = synonyms("AMY=AIMEE, COOK=COOKE=COOKIE=COKIE, ...")
# 
# Another issue is  a **partial match**: in the comic, some tiles, like "FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT" are 3 squares wide, and some, like "PRINCE" are only one square wide. For simplicity, I chose to have all my tiles be 2 squares wide, but I still want `'LLOYD'` to match the first name of `('FRANK LLOYD', 'WRIGHT')`. To accomplish this, the second argument to `synonyms` is a list of tiles; the function will go through these and add synset entries for parts of first names,
# so that both `'FRANK'` and `'LLOYD'` will match `'FRANK LLOYD'`. As for "PRINCE", he gets represented as the tile `('', 'PRINCE')`.

# # Final Result (with Random Restart)
# 
# The program sometimes gets stuck after placing relatively few tiles. I could modify the program to *back up* in this case, but it will be easier to just *give up* and restart with an empty board. I can restart multiple times, and accept the best board (the one on which the most tiles were placed):

print('Generated !! Stored in visualization.png')


# *Note:* I used a 16Ã—24 square board while the xkcd comic used 27Ã—35, but if I tried to fit 27 squares across then each tile would be smaller, and many names would overflow the sides of the dominoes too much. Here is the original xkcd comic:
# 
# [![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/name_dominoes_2x.png)](https://xkcd.com/1970/)
# 
# # What's Next?
# 
# I'm happy with the results, but here are some ideas for improvements, if you want something to work on:
# - Allow tiles that are 1 or 3 squares wide, like `('PRINCE',)` or `('FRANK', 'LLOYD', 'WRIGHT')`.
# - Print names vertically in tiles that are placed vertically, and upside down for tiles that are placed horizontally, but with the first name on the right.
# - Print shorter names with a bigger font and longer names with a smaller font.
# - Download a bunch of names from Wikipedia and fill a 200 Ã— 300 board.
# - If you like xkcd try [regex golf](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/xkcd1313.ipynb), and [part 2](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/xkcd1313-part2.ipynb).
