The cartoon https://xkcd.com/1970/ shows an example of a name domino.
Using the Wikipedia to extract names of people and creating the smallest possible name domino containing the maximum number of names extracted. 
Note - The name should be a title of the Wikipedia article about this person.

Go to Wikipedia from Wikimedia dumps, https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20181120/enwiki-20181120-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2 
Decide whether a given title represents a name of a person.
Run the script on Hadoop.
Make Domino from the names extracted using Python by making mapper and reducer classes.
